Wild Black Cherry,Prunus serotina,"I bet your taste buds are smiling at the thought of this! PrunusSerotina, more commonly referred to as wild black cherry, is an edible plant that is wise to be consumed in a very small proportion.

The leaves, flowers and other parts have a flavour that is slightly sour which may be comparable to lemons."
